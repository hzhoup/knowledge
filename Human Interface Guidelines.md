### Accessibility

**Design with accessibility in mind**. Accessibility is not just about making information available to people with disabilities -- it's about making information available to everyone, regardless of their capabilities or situation.

**Simplicity** -- Enabling familiar, consistent interactions that make complex tasks simple and straightforward to perform.

**Perceivability** -- Making sure that all content can be perceived whether people are using sight, hearing, or touch.

**Support personalization**.
